My apologies for the slight hissing on the track. Trey is slowly learning how to record audio and hasn't had ample time to play with [his new microphone](http://amazon.com/dp/B004MF39YS/ref=nosim/trey-20 "Amazon.com: Samson Meteor Mic USB Studio Microphone"). Also, horrible pounding on the keyboard since the mic was sitting on my desk. :(
