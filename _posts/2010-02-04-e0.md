[Jason Tan](http://jasontan.org/) talks about how and why he built [Nashville Eats Here](http://nashville.eatshere.net/) using [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/)'s API.

The interview was cut just a little short because we didn't realize how long Tumblr gave us for [a phone-in post](http://staff.tumblr.com/post/79132167/call-in-audio). Live and learn!
